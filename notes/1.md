## Introduction

* There are 3 broad strategies for learning behaviour:
	* Rewards
	* Demonstrations
	* Specification of optimal behaviour

* Challenges when learning behaviour:
	* Agent's current actions affects future data
		* Data is sequential and not iid
		* Plain supervised learning would lead to compounding errors
	* Rewards are very far in the future
		* How to attribute credit to actions
	* Performing actions in reality make take time
		* Think autonomous cars
	* How to compose behaviour
